FileMock is a simple yet powerful java library to convert Jason file into objects while writing unit tests. Most of the time writing unit test made difficult by creating nested service response. creating a proper input object may take hundreds of lines and hours of dev effort. `FileMock` is designed to reduce this effort by simply saving the response as JSON files and annotate the path in your test file.
